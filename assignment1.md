Question 1
 Briefly describe in prose your solution, both the pairs and stripes implementation.
  For example: how many MapReduce jobs? What are the input records?
  What are the intermediate key-value pairs? What are the final output records?
  A paragraph for each implementation is about the expected length.

Question 2
Ran on my own laptop:
The running time of the complete pairs implementation was 33.346s
The running time of the complete stripes implementation was 33.174s

Question 3
Ran on my own laptop:
The running time of the complete pairs implementation was 34.131s
The running time of the complete stripes implementation was 44.548s

Question 4
15152 + 15480 + 15960 + 15288 + 15318 = 77198 PMI pairs.
