Question 1
 Briefly describe in prose your solution, both the pairs and stripes implementation.
  For example: how many MapReduce jobs? What are the input records?
  What are the intermediate key-value pairs? What are the final output records?
  A paragraph for each implementation is about the expected length.

Question 2
Ran on my own laptop:
The running time of the complete pairs implementation was 33.346s
The running time of the complete stripes implementation was 33.174s

Question 3
Ran on my own laptop:
The running time of the complete pairs implementation was 34.131s
The running time of the complete stripes implementation was 44.548s

Question 4
15152 + 15480 + 15960 + 15288 + 15318 = 77198 PMI pairs.

Question 5
(maine, anjou)     3.6331422
Apparently, Maine and Anjou were two territories in france and one on Shakespeare's plays featured Margaret, wife of Henry IV, in which she receives the lands of Maine and Anjou. I would imagine that the two are mentioned within the same context many times, while being mentioned very rarely or none at all by itself.
